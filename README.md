# 👋 Hi, I'm Emma

I'm a She Codes Plus student and aspiring developer making the jump from pharmacy into tech. After a decade running chaotic dispensaries, I’m now deep in the world of full-stack web dev — building React frontends, Django REST APIs, and a future where my job doesn’t involve counting pills all day.

---

## About Me

- Studying full stack web development in the She Codes Plus 2025 cohort  
- Working with inventory systems and databases for years made me want to understand how things worked behind the scenes — now I’m deep into APIs, architecture, and clean UX
- Obsessed with data and analytics — especially visualisation  
- Driven by community, mentorship, and creating tech spaces that support everyone  

---

## 🌱 Learning

- Leveling up my React skills — state management, routing, and building cleaner, smarter components  
- Exploring Django REST Framework in more depth, especially permissions, authentication, models, and API structure  

---

## 🎯 Up Next

- TypeScript  
- Node.js  
- Tailwind CSS  
- Learning how to work with data in deeper and more flexible ways — from querying and transforming it to building visualisations and dashboards  
- Exploring different tools and ecosystems: SQL, PostgreSQL, and the basics of data pipelines  
- Learning how real-world applications handle analytics, metrics, and large datasets
